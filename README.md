# Introduction-to-Python-COVID-Project
This repository contains the deliverables for a data analysis project I completed during my coursework, focusing on behavioral trends during the COVID-19 pandemic. The project combines data preparation, visualization, and exploratory analysis to uncover insights into societal responses to the pandemic across different countries. By examining key behavioral factors such as mask-wearing compliance and willingness to self-isolate, the project seeks to identify patterns and generate hypotheses for future research.

## Project Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic has been one of the most transformative global events in recent history, serving as both a societal stress test and a scientific challenge. This project aimed to investigate behavioral responses to the pandemic using a dataset detailing global COVID-19-related behaviors and attitudes. The analysis focused on understanding how different factors, such as cultural norms and public policies, influenced individual and collective behavior.

## Deliverables

### 1. Knitted Markdown Report
The knitted report provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the data processing and visualization workflows. It showcases:
- **Data Preparation**: Steps for cleaning and formatting the dataset, including renaming columns for clarity and aligning data with the timeline of the pandemic.
- **Visualization**: Time-series plots, bar charts, and comparative analyses that illustrate key behavioral trends, such as mask-wearing compliance and self-isolation willingness.
- **Preliminary Insights**: Initial findings regarding behavioral trends and their relationship to a proxy for COVID-19 transmission rates.

### 2. Project Report
The written report expands on the projectâ€™s methodology, results, and limitations. It includes:
- **Problem Statement**: A discussion of the challenges in analyzing societal behaviors during the pandemic and the rationale behind this study.
- **Analysis Goals**: Five key research questions driving the project, focusing on behaviors like mask-wearing, self-isolation, and avoiding crowded areas.
- **Findings**
  - Significant disparities between symptomatic and advised self-isolation behaviors across countries.
  - Notable differences in mask-wearing compliance, with Singapore demonstrating high adherence and Denmark showing lower levels.
- **Limitations and Future Directions**: Reflections on the challenges of rigorous data analysis and suggestions for incorporating additional metrics and country-specific filters in future studies.

### Key Insights
1. **Willingness to Self-Isolate**: A consistent global trend emerged where individuals were more willing to self-isolate when symptomatic than when simply advised to do so. This behavior showed a slight correlation with transmission rates.
2. **Mask-Wearing Compliance**: Compliance levels varied significantly across countries, with cultural and policy differences likely playing a role. Denmark and Singapore represent two extremes of adherence, highlighting opportunities for comparative studies.
3. **Challenges in Data Preparation**: The preparation process for this analysis highlighted the complexity of working with pandemic-related data. Key challenges included:
    - **Inconsistent Data Formats**: Variations in column names, missing values, and temporal alignment across datasets required substantial preprocessing.
    - **Granularity and Scope**: Data often lacked the granularity necessary for detailed analyses (e.g., regional breakdowns) or included excessive noise that complicated interpretation.
    - **Dynamic Nature of the Pandemic**: Rapid changes in public health policies and societal behaviors made it difficult to ensure temporal consistency when aligning behaviors with transmission rates.

### Conclusion
This project served as an opportunity to explore the intersection of behavioral science and data visualization. While the analysis was limited by scope and data availability, it underscores the potential for future research to adopt broader, more nuanced methodologies to examine behavioral trends during crises.
